# SECL Land Clubbing and Employment Management System

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) during my vocational training at South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), Bilaspur. The project helps manage land acquisition records and automates employment distribution using a clubbing logic where landowners with insufficient land can combine holdings with others to become eligible for jobs.

##  Key Features:
- Dual table interface (Land Records & Employment Records)
- Land clubbing logic based on total area
- Dynamic employment form with validation
- Auto-generated employment entries linked via `acq_awd_id`
- RESTful backend APIs with MongoDB storage

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB
- API Integration: Axios

## Developed as part of my internship at SECL
